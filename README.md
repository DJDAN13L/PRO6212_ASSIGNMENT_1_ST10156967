Part 1: Project Planning and Prototype Development

 Project Overview
The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is designed to assist Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers in submitting monthly claims.  
The system allows:
- Lecturers to submit hours worked and upload supporting documents.
- Coordinators and Academic Managers to verify, approve, or reject claims.
- Claim status tracking via a dashboard.

This repository contains all deliverables for Part 1 of the POE, which focuses on planning and prototype design.
